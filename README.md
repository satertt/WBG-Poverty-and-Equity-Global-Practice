# WBG-Poverty and Equity Global Practice

## Introduction

&emsp; The purpose of these exercises is to assess the following capabilities: [1] Programing skills in Stata to produce self-contained and automated code, [2] intuitive visualization skills and sophisticated management of Microsoft Excel, [3] economic analysis, and [4] writing skills.erty-and-Equity-Global-Practice
  
&emsp; The objective is to create a dynamic Excel tool to easily understand the results of the macro-accounting decomposition methodology. This methodology consists on decomposing the growth rates of total economic output (i.e., GDP) into growth rates of factor inputs (i.e., capital, labor, and human capital) and a residual (i.e., GDP growth that is unexplained by increases in factor inputs). This residual will be interpreted as growth in productivity, known as Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Part of your goal is to estimate the TFP based on the models described below.
  
&emsp; Using the information of the dta file (growth_accounting.dta) the project will estimate, based on the two models below, the contribution of TFP growth to total growth of the economy (GPD) and compare it with the corresponding contribution of Labor and Capital growth contributions. Given that the depreciation rate of capital (ùõø) and the income share of capital (ùõº) are unknown values, the project will create several scenarios with different values for these two parameters. (The depreciation rate could be defined with the values 3%, 6%, and 8%, and for the income share of capital the values are 20%, 30%, and 40%). Also, assume the initial year is 1990.

&emsp; The project will do all the calculations using Stata, export the results into an Excel file, and create a pivot table that allows the user to select the model, the country, the depreciation rate of capital, and the income share of capital.
The pivot table (or pivot chart) will include the contribution of capital, labor, and TFP to the total growth rate of GDP that can be filtered by country and the different values of the parameters. More pivot tables with relevant information will also be attached in the Excel files, such as annual growth for each component or comparison of different countries‚Äô performance.
