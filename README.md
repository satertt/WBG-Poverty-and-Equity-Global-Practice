# WBG-Poverty and Equity Global Practice
&emsp; The purpose of these exercises is to assess the following capabilities: [1] Programing skills in Stata to produce self-contained and automated code, [2] intuitive visualization skills and sophisticated management of Microsoft Excel, [3] economic analysis, and [4] writing skills.erty-and-Equity-Global-Practice
  
&emsp; Your objective is to create a dynamic Excel tool to easily understand the results of the macro-accounting decomposition methodology. This methodology consists on decomposing the growth rates of total economic output (i.e., GDP) into growth rates of factor inputs (i.e., capital, labor, and human capital) and a residual (i.e., GDP growth that is unexplained by increases in factor inputs). This residual will be interpreted as growth in productivity, known as Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Part of your goal is to estimate the TFP based on the models described below.
  
&emsp; Using the information of the dta file (growth_accounting.dta) we need you to estimate, based on the two models below, the contribution of TFP growth to total growth of the economy (GPD) and compare it with the corresponding contribution of Labor and Capital growth contributions. Given that the depreciation rate of capital (ùõø) and the income share of capital (ùõº) are unknown values, we need you to create several scenarios with different values for these two parameters. This is in fact the core of the exercise. We suggest you could use for the depreciation
